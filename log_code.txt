#1: Imports ABC (Abstract Base Class) and abstractmethod decorators to define abstract classes and methods. These are used for defining a class interface that must be implemented by any subclass.

#2: Constructor method to initialize the transaction with a value (e.g., deposit or withdrawal amount).
#3: Abstract method register, which must be implemented by subclasses. This method will define how a transaction is recorded for an account.

#4: register method for Deposit checks if the deposit amount is valid (greater than zero). If invalid, prints an error message and returns False.
#5: If the deposit is valid, it updates the account's balance and adds the deposit to the transaction history.

#6: checks if the withdrawal amount is valid (greater than zero). If invalid, prints an error message and returns False.
#7: If the withdrawal amount exceeds the account balance, it prints an error message and returns False.
#8: If the withdrawal is valid, it reduces the account balance and adds the withdrawal to the transaction history.

#9: The History class holds a list of transactions made for an account.
#10: Adds a transaction description (e.g., deposit or withdrawal) to the transaction history.

#11: Defines the Account class, which holds account information, including the client, account number, agency, and balance. It also has a transaction history.
#12: A method to perform a deposit. It creates a Deposit transaction and registers it for the account.
#13: A method to perform a withdrawal. It creates a Withdraw transaction and registers it for the account.

#14: Defines a subclass CurrentAccount that inherits from Account and has specific features, such as withdrawal limits.
#15: The CurrentAccount constructor initializes additional attributes: the withdrawal limit per day and the number of withdrawals made.
#16: Checks if the account has reached its daily withdrawal limit. If yes, it prevents further withdrawals.
#17: Checks if the withdrawal amount exceeds the account's limit. If yes, it prevents the withdrawal.
#18: Calls the parent class withdraw method to perform the withdrawal, and if successful, increments the withdrawal count.

#19: Defines the Client class to represent a customer. It holds client information (name, birth, CPF, address) and a list of accounts.
#20: Adds an account to the client's list of accounts.

#21: Two global lists, users (to store clients) and accounts (to store all accounts).

#22: A function to create a new user by checking if the CPF already exists.

#23: A function to create a current account for a user based on the CPF.
