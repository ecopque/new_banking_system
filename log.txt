#2: Constructor method to initialize the transaction with a value (e.g., deposit or withdrawal amount).
#3: Abstract method register, which must be implemented by subclasses. This method will define how a transaction is recorded for an account.

#5: If the deposit is valid, it updates the account's balance and adds the deposit to the transaction history.
